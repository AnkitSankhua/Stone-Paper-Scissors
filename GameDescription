"Stone Paper Scissors" is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool between two people. 
It's typically played between two players who simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 

The possible shapes are:

1. Stone (also known as Rock): Represented by a fist. It defeats Scissors but is defeated by Paper.
2. Paper: Represented by an open hand. It defeats Stone but is defeated by Scissors.
3. Scissors: Represented by a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V. It defeats Paper but is defeated by Stone.

The game is usually played in a best-of-three format or any predetermined number of rounds. 
The winner of each round is determined by the rules mentioned above: Stone defeats Scissors, Scissors defeat Paper, and Paper defeats Stone. 
If both players choose the same shape, the round is usually considered a tie and may not count towards the overall score.

Here's how a typical game might play out:

1. Player A chooses Paper, and Player B chooses Stone. Player A wins because Paper defeats Stone.
2. Player A chooses Scissors, and Player B chooses Paper. Player A wins because Scissors defeat Paper.
3. Player A chooses Stone, and Player B chooses Scissors. Player A wins because Stone defeats Scissors.

In this example, Player A wins all three rounds and wins the overall game. 
The simplicity and randomness of the game make it a popular choice for quick decision-making, as well as a fun and light-hearted activity.
